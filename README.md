# FlowbiteIcons

[Flowbite Icons](https://flowbite.com/icons) "is a free and open-source collection of SVG icons that you can use in personal and commercial projects by giving attribution." This package gives you Elixir functions to drop Flowbite Icons into your HTML, styled with arbitrary classes.

This library provides optimized svgs for each Flowbite Icon packaged as a Phoenix Component.
